Nanofolks is a platform for building friendly AI crews — teams of characters that collaborate to help you think, create, plan, and build.

Instead of interacting with a single assistant, Nanofolks lets you work alongside a group of AI specialists with distinct roles and personalities.

From pirate crews to space teams to creative collectives, your AI companions don't just respond — they work together.

## What Makes Nanofolks Different?

| | |
|---|---|
| ✨ | **Collaboration** over automation |
| 🎭 | **Characters** over tools |
| 🤝 | **Companionship** over commands |

It's not just an assistant — it's a team.

One that can help with:

- planning
- creative work
- coding
- research
- social media
- everyday life

and so much more!

## Built for Real Use

Nanofolks provides a flexible architecture for:

| | |
|---|---|
| 🧠 | multi-agent collaboration |
| 🧩 | role-based personalities |
| 🔧 | extensibility |
| 💬 | multi-platform interaction |

**Inspired by nanobot's simplicity, Nanofolks expands the concept into a more expressive, team-oriented system.**

> [!TIP]
> Nanofolks is a fork of [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot). We maintain full compatibility while adding crew-based features.

# Core Concepts

This section explains the architectural concepts behind Nanofolks. Understanding these will help you configure and customize your crew.

## 🧠 Memory System

Nanofolks has a production-hardened memory system that learns from every conversation.

### How It Works

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Event Logging** | Every message (user and assistant) is stored in a local SQLite database with full conversation context |
| **Entity Extraction** | The system automatically identifies people, places, organizations, and concepts mentioned in conversations |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Entities are connected through relationships, creating a map of what you've discussed |
| **Preference Learning** | Nanofolks detects feedback patterns and learns your communication style, preferences, and habits over time |
| **Context Assembly** | When you send a message, Nanofolks retrieves relevant memories and assembles them into context |

### Why It Matters

Unlike simple chat histories, Nanofolks builds a persistent knowledge base that:
- Survives restarts and new conversations
- Connects related information across time
- Improves the more you use it

---

## 🔐 Secret Sanitizer

Nanofolks automatically protects sensitive information from being exposed.

### What It Detects

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| API keys | OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq |
| Tokens | Bearer tokens, JWTs |
| Credentials | Passwords, database strings |
| Keys | Private keys, SSH credentials |

### Where It Applies

The sanitizer intercepts content at multiple points:

| Location | Protection |
|----------|------------|
| **AI Messages** | Secrets masked before reaching the LLM |
| **Log Files** | Nothing sensitive written to disk |
| **Session History** | Stored conversations have secrets removed |
| **Tool Outputs** | Results screened before display |

### Example

```
Input:  "My API key is sk-or-v1-abc123..."
Output: "My API key is sk-or-v1-ab***..." (masked)
```

---

## 🛡️ Skill Verification Flow

Skills extend Nanofolks' capabilities. Before any skill is used, it goes through security verification.

### The Workflow

```
┌─────────────────┐
│ 1. Auto-Detect │
│   New skills   │
└────────┬────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ 2. Risk Scoring │
│   Analyze code │
└────────┬────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ 3. Approval     │
│   Block if risk │
└────────┬────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ 4. Runtime      │
│   Verification  │
└─────────────────┘
```

### Risk Levels

| Level | Icon | Examples |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Critical** | 🚫 | Credential theft, malware |
| **High** | ⚠️ | Shell injection, system mods |
| **Medium** | ⚡ | Obfuscation, suspicious downloads |
| **Low** | ℹ️ | Binary execution, external URLs |

---

## 💭 Chain of Thought

Nanofolks doesn't just respond — it thinks through problems.

### The Pattern

```
Observation → Thought → Action → Observation → Thought → (repeat)
```

### Multi-Turn Reasoning

For complex tasks, Nanofolks can:
- Break down problems into steps
- Plan before executing
- Reflect on intermediate results
- Correct mistakes mid-process

### Tool Execution Loop

When tools are needed, Nanofolks:
1. Decides which tool to use
2. Executes the tool
3. Observes the result
4. Incorporates results into thinking
5. Continues or responds

---

## 📦 Context Compaction

Long conversations can exceed AI model limits. Nanofolks intelligently manages this.

### The Problem

AI models have maximum context windows (typically 8K-200K tokens). Without management:
- Conversations eventually hit the limit
- Old context gets dropped
- Nanofolks "forgets" earlier parts of the conversation

### How Compaction Works

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Token Tracking** | Real-time counting using tiktoken (not estimates) |
| **Threshold Warning** | 70% → shows warning in response |
| **Compaction Trigger** | 80% → triggers smart compression |
| **Tool Chain Safety** | Never separates tool calls from results |

### Compaction Modes

| Mode | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Summary** | Default — AI generates smart summaries |
| **Token-Limit** | Emergency — preserves recent messages only |
| **Off** | Manual — you control when to compact |

### Large Output Handling

Tool outputs over 10KB are stored separately in SQLite to prevent:
- API errors from oversized payloads
- Context pollution
- Cost overruns

---

## 🎯 Tier-Aware Routing

Not every message needs the most powerful (and expensive) AI model. Nanofolks intelligently routes messages to appropriate models.

### The Two-Layer System

```
User Message
    ↓
Layer 1: Client-Side Classification (~1ms)
  → Fast heuristic analysis
  → Handles ~85% of messages instantly
    ↓ (if ambiguous)
Layer 2: LLM-Assisted Classification (~200ms)
  → More accurate edge case handling
    ↓
Execute with Selected Model
```

### Tiers

| Tier | When Used | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Simple** | Quick questions | "What's the weather?" |
| **Medium** | General tasks | "Write me an email" |
| **Complex** | Detailed work | "Analyze this data" |
| **Reasoning** | Logic problems | "Prove this theorem" |
| **Coding** | Programming | "Debug this function" |

### Sticky Routing

Once a tier is selected, it "sticks" for the conversation context:
- Consistent responses
- Cost predictability
- Better coherence

### Cost Savings

Typical usage (45% simple, 35% medium, 15% complex, 5% reasoning):

| Scenario | Cost per Million Tokens |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Without routing** | $75.00 (always best model) |
| **With routing** | $3.17 (blended) |
| **Savings** | **Up to 96%** 🎉 |

---

## 💓 Multi-Heartbeat System

Nanofolks doesn't just wait for you to message it — it can proactively act.

### Scheduled Tasks (Cron)

```bash
# Every morning at 9am
nanobot cron add --name "morning" --message "What's on my calendar?" --cron "0 9 * * *"

# Hourly health checks
nanobot cron add --name "hourly" --message "Check system status" --every 3600
```

### Proactive Wake-Up

The heartbeat system:
- Wakes Nanofolks at scheduled times
- Runs background tasks
- Can message you proactively
- Maintains state between runs

### Activity Tracking

Monitors when you're active to:
- Determine when to run background processing
- Avoid interrupting conversations
- Optimize memory extraction timing

---

## 📝 Work Logs

Nanofolks maintains persistent logs of completed work for future reference.

### What Gets Logged

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Task completions | Timestamps, outcomes |
| Tool executions | Results, errors |
| Research | Findings, sources |
| Artifacts | Generated files, code |

### Why It Matters

Work logs enable:
- **Audit trail** — Know what was done and when
- **Context continuity** — Pick up where you left off
- **Reference** — Look back at previous solutions
- **Learning** — Nanofolks improves from past work

### Access

Work logs are stored in the workspace and can be:
- Searched via memory commands
- Referenced in conversations
- Exported for external use

---

## 🤖 Multi-Bot Architecture

Nanofolks supports multiple AI characters working together as a crew.

### The Crew Concept

A "crew" is a group of 6 AI characters, each with:

- **Personality** — How they respond (from the theme)
- **Role** — What they're good at
- **Expertise** — Specific knowledge domains

### Your Team

Each Nanofolks crew has 6 bots:

| Bot | Role | Expertise |
|-----|------|-----------|
| **Leader** (@nanobot) | Coordinates the crew | Planning, delegation, decision-making |
| **Researcher** (@researcher) | Deep research | Analysis, information gathering |
| **Coder** (@coder) | Technical implementation | Code, debugging, architecture |
| **Social** (@social) | Community engagement | Communication, user relations |
| **Creative** (@creative) | Creative work | Design, brainstorming, content |
| **Auditor** (@auditor) | Quality review | Validation, compliance, testing |

### How It Works

```
Workspace/
├── bots/
│   ├── leader.yaml      # Primary bot
│   ├── specialist.yaml # Additional bots
│   └── creative.yaml
├── memory/             # Shared knowledge
├── skills/             # Crew skills
└── config.yaml         # Crew configuration
```

### Single Bot Mode

Not ready for a full crew? Nanofolks works perfectly as a single assistant:
- Default workspace has one bot
- Works in DM mode
- Same memory and learning capabilities
- Easy to add more bots later

### Why Multiple Bots?

| Benefit | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Specialization** | Coding bot, research bot |
| **Personality** | Different characters for moods |
| **Collaboration** | Bots discuss and debate |
| **Reliability** | Backup if one is unavailable |

# Philosophy

Nanofolks isn't about replacing you.

It's about surrounding you with the right help — in a way that feels natural, collaborative, and even a little fun.

We believe AI should:
- Work *with* you, not *for* you
- Have personality and character
- Learn and improve over time
- Feel like a team, not a tool
