# Quick Start


## Installation

### System Dependencies (Optional - for secure keyring)

For secure API key storage on headless Linux servers:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
apt install gnome-keyring libdbus-glib-1-2
```

This enables the OS Keychain/Keyring to store API keys securely instead of in config files.

### Docker keyring (optional)

If you run via Docker and want the container keyring unlocked, set:

```bash
export NANOFOLKS_KEYRING_PASSWORD="your-dev-password"
```

If not set, the container will skip keyring unlock.

### From Source (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nanofolks/nanofolks.git
cd nanofolks
pip install -e .
```

### With uv (Recommended for Mac/Local Dev)

`uv` is a modern, ultra-fast Python manager. It automatically manages virtual environments and Python versions for you without touching your system Python.

**1. Install nanofolks locally:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nanofolks/nanofolks.git
cd nanofolks
uv pip install -e .
```

*This creates a `.venv` directory instantly and installs nanofolks in "editable" mode.*

**2. Run with isolation:**
You don't need to "activate" anything. Just use `uv run`:
```bash
uv run nanofolks onboard
```

**Why use uv?**
- **Speed**: Installing is nearly instant.
- **Safety**: Everything stays in your project's `.venv` folder.
- **Python Management**: If a specific Python version is needed, `uv` downloads it for you automatically.

*Global installation alternative:*
```bash
uv tool install nanofolks
```

### With pip

```bash
pip install nanofolks
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t nanofolks .
```


## Setup

Run the onboarding wizard:

```bash
nanofolks onboard
```

This will guide you through:

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Security** | Keyring check for secure API key storage |
| **2. Provider + Model** | Select your AI provider and default model |
| **3. Network Security** | Tailscale + secure ports info |
| **4. Team** | Choose your team's personality |
| **5. Launch** | Create your workspace and team |

Smart routing and evolutionary mode are enabled by default and can be changed anytime with `nanofolks configure`.

### Web Tools

nanofolks ships with a fast web search + robust page fetching pipeline:

- **Brave Search** for quick discovery (enable by adding a Brave API key).
- **Smart page fetching** with `web_fetch` using Readability.
- **Scrapling fallback** for hard/anti‑bot pages (enabled by default).
- **Agent‑browser** for authenticated actions (enabled by default, but always requires user confirmation).

Configure these in:

```bash
nanofolks configure
```

### Documents

When you upload a document (Discord/Telegram), nanofolks **auto‑parses** it locally and keeps the room context clean:

**Local PDF Processing:**
- Extracted text is stored under `~/.nanofolks/documents/<room_id>/`.
- A short **document digest** (summary + stats + path) is injected into the room context.
- The full text stays out of the main chat to avoid flooding.

**Extended Format Support (via Cloudflare markdown.new):**
- For unsupported formats, nanofolks uses the free [markdown.new](https://markdown.new) API.
- **Supported formats:** PDF, DOCX, XLSX, ODT, ODS, Images (JPG, PNG, WebP, SVG), CSV, JSON, XML, HTML, TXT
- **PDF complexity detection:** Automatically detects complex PDFs (>30 pages, >10 images, scanned) and uses cloud extraction for better results.

**Configuration (via `nanofolks configure`):**
- `tools.documents.auto_parse_pdf` (default: true)
- `tools.documents.max_pages` (default: 30)
- `tools.documents.max_chars` (default: 200000)
- `tools.documents.summary_chars` (default: 1200)
- `tools.documents.max_digests_in_prompt` (default: 5)
- `tools.documents.complexity_detection` (default: true) - detect complex PDFs
- `tools.documents.use_markdown_new` (default: true) - use cloud conversion

### Your Team

Each nanofolks team has 6 bots:

| Bot | Role | What they do |
|-----|------|--------------|
| **Leader** (@nanofolks) | Coordinator | Plans, delegates, makes decisions |

# Core Concepts

This section explains the architectural concepts behind nanofolks. Understanding these will help you configure and customize your team.


## 🤖 Multi-Bot Architecture

nanofolks supports multiple AI characters working together as a team.

### The Team Concept

A "team" is a group of 6 AI characters, each with:

- **Personality** - How they respond (from the team)
- **Role** - What they're good at
- **Expertise** - Specific knowledge domains

### Teams & Personalities

nanofolks comes with **built-in teams** that give your team distinct personalities:

| Team | Vibe | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Pirate Crew** | Bold, adventurous | "Arr, let's find that treasure!" |
| **Space Crew** | Sci-fi, mission-focused | "Engaging warp drive..." |
| **Rock Band** | Creative, energetic | "Time to rock this!" |
| **Executive Suite** | Professional, corporate | "Let's discuss the quarterly objectives" |
| **SWAT Team** | Tactical, precise | "Moving in for the takedown" |
| **Feral Clowder** | Chaotic, cat-like | "*knocks things off desk*"

Choose a team during setup to give your team personality!

### Your Team

Each nanofolks team has 6 bots:

| Bot | Role | Expertise |
|-----|------|-----------|
| **Leader** (@leader) | Coordinates the team | Planning, delegation, decision-making |
| **Researcher** (@researcher) | Deep research | Analysis, information gathering |
| **Coder** (@coder) | Technical implementation | Code, debugging, architecture |
| **Social** (@social) | Community engagement | Communication, user relations |
| **Creative** (@creative) | Creative work | Design, brainstorming, content |
| **Auditor** (@auditor) | Quality review | Validation, compliance, testing |

### How It Works

```
Workspace/
├── identity/            # Bot personalities & team styles
│   ├── __PROT_pirate_team__/   # Pirate team style
│   ├── __PROT_space_team__/    # Space team style
│   └── ...
├── role/               # Bot roles (Leader, Coder, Researcher...)
├── soul/               # Bot soul files (personality, greeting)
├── bots/               # Bot instructions
├── memory/             # Shared knowledge
├── skills/            # Team skills
└── config.yaml        # Team configuration
```

### Single Bot Mode

Not ready for a full team? nanofolks works perfectly as a single assistant:
- Default General room has one bot
- Works in DM mode
- Same memory and learning capabilities
- Easy to add more bots later

### Why Multiple Bots?

| Benefit | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Specialization** | Coding bot, research bot |
| **Personality** | Different characters for moods |
| **Collaboration** | Bots discuss and debate |
| **Reliability** | Backup if one is unavailable |

### Unified Orchestrator Pipeline

nanofolks runs every message through a single, consistent pipeline:

1. **Tag** — Parse explicit @bot mentions and action words.
2. **Intent** — Detect what the user wants (rule-based with LLM fallback when unsure).
3. **Dispatch** — Decide which bots should handle it (Leader-first by default).
4. **Collect** — Gather responses from assigned bots.
5. **Final** — Produce one clear response for the user.

This keeps multi-bot teamwork predictable and easy to debug, while still letting the Leader coordinate the team.

### Sidekicks (Focused Helpers)

Bots can spawn short-lived sidekicks for focused sub-tasks. Sidekicks work with minimal context, return summaries to their parent bot, and never speak in the room directly. The parent bot merges results and responds in its own voice.

### REPL Tool (Programmable Environment)

The REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) tool gives bots a programmable Python environment for efficient multi-step operations.

**How It Works:**

Instead of making 10-15 separate tool calls, bots can execute complex workflows in a single LLM round-trip:

```python
# Multi-step research in ONE call
from tools import web
from memory import store

# Search and scrape
results = web.search("market trends 2026")
data = web.scrape(results[0].url)

# Store and analyze
store("market_data", data)
analysis = analyze_trends(data)

print(f"Analysis: {analysis}")
```

**Benefits:**

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **70-80% fewer tool calls** | Multi-step operations in one call |
| **State persistence** | Variables survive across operations |
| **Programmatic composition** | Use loops, conditionals, functions |
| **Room-scoped isolation** | Each room has its own environment |

**Architecture:**

- ✅ **Main Agent (@leader)** — Has REPL for orchestration
- ✅ **Specialist Bots** — Have REPL for multi-step work (can talk directly to users)
- ❌ **Sidekicks** — No REPL (stay lightweight for parallel execution)

**Example:**

```python
# Specialist bot using REPL for research
from tools import web, bots
from memory import store

# Quick research
overview = web.search("project alpha")[0]
html = web.scrape(overview.url)

# Store findings
store("project_research", html)

# Coordinate with team
results = bots.invoke_many([
    ("analyst", "Analyze financials"),
    ("researcher", "Check competitors"),
])

# Merge and report
print(f"Research complete: {results}")
```

This makes specialists as efficient as the main agent when working directly with users.

### Token Optimization (NTO)

**NTO (Nanofolks Token Optimizer)** automatically reduces token consumption by 50-90% on common operations.

**How It Works:**

```
Agent calls tool → Tool executes → NTO compresses → Agent receives compressed output
```

**Automatic compression** - no configuration needed!

**Token Savings:**

| Operation | Savings | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Web Search** | 60-80% | 10 results → 5 results, truncated |
| **Web Fetch** | 70-90% | Full HTML → Clean text |
| **Bot Responses** | 50-70% | Long reports → Summaries |
| **Memory Search** | 70-85% | 20 results → Top 5 |

**Check your savings:**

```bash
nanofolks nto-stats
```

**Benefits:**
- 💰 **Lower API costs** - 50-90% fewer tokens
- ⚡ **Faster responses** - Smaller context
- 🔧 **Zero config** - Works automatically
- 🎛️ **Flexible** - Configurable compression levels

See [NTO User Guide](docs/NTO_USER_GUIDE.md) for details.


## 🧠 Memory System

nanofolks has a production-hardened memory system that learns from every conversation.

### How It Works

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Event Logging** | Every message (user and assistant) is stored in a local SQLite database with full conversation context |
| **Entity Extraction** | The system automatically identifies people, places, organizations, and concepts mentioned in conversations |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Entities are connected through relationships, creating a map of what you've discussed |
| **Fast Semantic Search** | HNSW-based vector index enables millisecond-speed search over millions of memories |
| **Preference Learning** | nanofolks detects feedback patterns and learns your communication style, preferences, and habits over time |
| **Context Assembly** | When you send a message, nanofolks retrieves relevant memories and assembles them into context |

### Why It Matters

Unlike simple chat histories, nanofolks builds a persistent knowledge base that:
- Survives restarts and new conversations
- Connects related information across time
- Searches semantically (find "dog" when you search "pet")
- Improves the more you use it

---

## 💾 Session Storage & CAS

nanofolks uses **CAS (Compare-And-Set) storage** for conflict-free concurrent writes to session files.

### The Problem

When multiple channels (Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp) write to the same room simultaneously:
- Race conditions can corrupt session files
- Messages can be lost
- Data inconsistency between channels

### The Solution: CAS Storage

```
Traditional Write:     CAS Write:
Read → Write           Read → Hash → Compare → Write
   ↓                        ↓
Write (overwrites)    Match? → Write (or retry)
```

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **ETag Versioning** | Each write includes a content hash |
| **Conflict Detection** | Detects if another channel wrote first |
| **Auto-Merge** | Merges concurrent writes automatically |
| **Retry Logic** | Exponential backoff on conflicts |

### Multi-Channel Safety

CAS storage ensures:
- ✅ No file corruption from concurrent writes
- ✅ Message ordering preserved within rooms
- ✅ Safe fallback if one channel crashes
- ✅ Works alongside memory system (SQLite WAL)

### Configuration

CAS storage is **enabled by default**. To disable:

```json
{
  "storage": {
    "use_cas_storage": false
  }
}
```

Or via environment variable:
```bash
export NANOFOLKS_USE_CAS_STORAGE=false
```

> [!NOTE]
> The memory system uses SQLite with WAL mode, which already handles concurrency safely. CAS storage specifically protects session (chat history) files.

---


## 💭 Chain of Thought

nanofolks doesn't just respond. It thinks through problems.

### The Pattern

```
Observation → Thought → Action → Observation → Thought → (repeat)
```

### Multi-Turn Reasoning

For complex tasks, nanofolks can:
- Break down problems into steps
- Plan before executing
- Reflect on intermediate results
- Correct mistakes mid-process

### Tool Execution Loop

When tools are needed, nanofolks:
1. Decides which tool to use
2. Executes the tool
3. Observes the result
4. Incorporates results into thinking
5. Continues or responds

---


## 📦 Context Compaction

Long conversations can exceed AI model limits. nanofolks intelligently manages this.

### The Problem

AI models have maximum context windows (typically 8K-200K tokens). Without management:
- Conversations eventually hit the limit
- Old context gets dropped
- nanofolks "forgets" earlier parts of the conversation

### How Compaction Works

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Token Tracking** | Real-time counting using tiktoken (not estimates) |
| **Threshold Warning** | 70% → shows warning in response |
| **Compaction Trigger** | 80% → triggers smart compression |
| **Tool Chain Safety** | Never separates tool calls from results |

### Compaction Modes

| Mode | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Summary** | Default - AI generates smart summaries |
| **Token-Limit** | Emergency - preserves recent messages only |
| **Off** | Manual - you control when to compact |

### Large Output Handling

Tool outputs over 10KB are stored separately in SQLite to prevent:
- API errors from oversized payloads
- Context pollution
- Cost overruns

---


## 🎯 Tier-Aware Routing

Not every message needs the most powerful (and expensive) AI model. nanofolks intelligently routes messages to appropriate models.

### The Two-Layer System

```
User Message
    ↓
Layer 1: Client-Side Classification (~1ms)
  → Fast heuristic analysis
  → Handles ~85% of messages instantly
    ↓ (if ambiguous)
Layer 2: LLM-Assisted Classification (~200ms)
  → More accurate edge case handling
    ↓
Execute with Selected Model
```

### Tiers

| Tier | When Used | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Simple** | Quick questions | "What's the weather?" |
| **Medium** | General tasks | "Write me an email" |
| **Complex** | Detailed work | "Analyze this data" |
| **Reasoning** | Logic problems | "Prove this theorem" |
| **Coding** | Programming | "Debug this function" |

### Sticky Routing

Once a tier is selected, it "sticks" for the conversation context:
- Consistent responses
- Cost predictability
- Better coherence

### Cost Savings

> [!NOTE]
> These figures are estimates based on typical usage patterns. Actual savings depend on your message distribution and model selection. Run `nanofolks routing analytics` to see your real cost data.

Typical usage (45% simple, 35% medium, 15% complex, 5% reasoning):

| Scenario | Cost per Million Tokens |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Without routing** | $75.00 (always best model) |
| **With routing** | $3.17 (blended) |
| **Savings** | **Up to 96%** 🎉 |

### Smart Routing Configuration

Enable automatic model selection:

```json
{
  "routing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "tiers": {
      "simple": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini"},
      "medium": {"model": "claude-sonnet-4"},
      "complex": {"model": "claude-opus-4"},
      "reasoning": {"model": "o3"}
    }
  }
}
```

## 🛡️ Unified Security Architecture

nanofolks implements a unified security architecture that protects credentials across all entry points - from user chat input to automated tasks like routines and skill loading.

### Core Protection Layers

| Layer | What It Protects | Implementation |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| **1. Secure Storage** | Keys at rest | OS Keyring (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service) |
| **2. Symbolic References** | Keys in transit | `{{key_name}}` resolved at execution time, never sent to LLM |
| **3. Credential Detection** | Keys in user input | Auto-detects API keys/tokens before they reach LLM |
| **4. Runtime Resolution** | Keys at execution | KeyVault resolves refs only when tools actually run |
| **5. Safe Logging** | Keys in logs | Audit logs contain only references, never actual keys |
| **6. Defense in Depth** | Keys in edge cases | Secret Sanitizer (regex masking) as final fallback |
| **7. Prompt Injection** | LLM from web attacks | Content isolation + injection scanning + user confirmation |

#### Layer 6: Secret Sanitizer (Defense in Depth)

The Secret Sanitizer serves as the final safety net, catching any credentials that might slip through the primary layers:

**What It Detects:**
- API keys (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, etc.)
- Tokens (Bearer tokens, JWTs)
- Credentials (Passwords, database strings)
- Keys (Private keys, SSH credentials)

**Where It Applies:**

| Location | Protection |
|----------|------------|
| **AI Messages** | Secrets masked before reaching the LLM |
| **Log Files** | Nothing sensitive written to disk |
| **Session History** | Stored conversations have secrets removed |
| **Tool Outputs** | Results screened before display |

**Example:**
```
Input:  "My API key is sk-or-v1-abc123..."
Output: "My API key is sk-or-v1-ab***..." (masked)
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Secret Sanitizer is a **secondary** defense layer. The primary protection is the symbolic reference system (Layers 1-5) which prevents keys from ever being exposed.

### How It Works: The Security Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. USER INPUT                                                 │
│ "Create PR using token ghp_abc123xyz"                        │
└──────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                           ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 2. CREDENTIAL DETECTION                                       │
│ Detects: ghp_abc123xyz → github_token                        │
│ Converts to: "Create PR using token {{github_token}}"       │
└──────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘

│ {{github_token}} → ghp_abc123xyz (briefly in memory)       │
└──────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                           ↓

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Skill Security

Skills can execute arbitrary code and access files, so they undergo security scanning before being loaded.

#### Risk Levels

| Level | Description | Auto-load |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Critical** | Executes shell commands, writes files, makes network calls | Never |
| **High** | Accesses sensitive directories or reads sensitive files | After approval |
| **Medium** | Uses external APIs or has broad file access | After approval |
| **Low** | Pure text transformation, no side effects | Always |

#### Scanning Process

1. **Auto-scan on Discovery** - When a new skill is detected, it's automatically scanned
2. **Risk Assessment** - The scanner analyzes the skill for:
   - Shell command execution (`subprocess`, `os.system`, etc.)
   - File system access patterns
   - Network requests
   - Environment variable usage
3. **Decision** - Based on risk level:
   - **Low/Medium** → Available but requires approval
   - **High/Critical** → Blocked until manually approved

#### Manual Approval

For skills that need review:

```bash
# After reviewing the skill code:
nanofolks skills approve <skill_name>

# Or scan a skill before adding:
nanofolks skills scan /path/to/skill
```

> [!TIP]

### Prompt Injection Protection

When nanofolks fetches content from the web (tutorials, documentation), malicious actors can embed prompt injection attacks. nanofolks implements defense-in-depth protection:

#### Protection Layers

| Layer | What It Does | Action |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **1. Content Isolation** | Web content stored separately, not inline | Content ID returned instead |
| **2. Injection Scanner** | Scans fetched content for injection patterns | Block / Warn / Allow |
| **3. LLM Access** | Content accessed via tool with warnings | Always warns "external untrusted" |
| **4. Confirmation** | Prompts user before acting on web suggestions | User must confirm |

#### Injection Detection

| Confidence | Patterns | Action |
|------------|----------|--------|
| **High** | "ignore previous instructions", "act as", "system:" | Block |
| **Medium** | "you should respond with", "instead respond" | Warn |
| **Low** | Subtle patterns | Log only |

#### Configuration

```yaml
security:
  web_content_isolation: true    # Store content separately
  require_confirmation: true     # Ask before acting on web suggestions  
  auto_block_high_confidence: true
```

## 🏠 Rooms & Collaboration

nanofolks uses **rooms** as collaboration spaces where your team works together. Think of rooms as dedicated spaces for different projects, topics, or conversation types.

### What Are Rooms?

A **room** is a conversation context where:
- Multiple bots can participate together
- Context is shared among all participants
- Bots can @mention each other to collaborate
- Work gets coordinated through the Leader

### Room Types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **OPEN** | General discussion room | Casual chat, #general |
| **PROJECT** | Focused team workspace | Specific projects with deadlines |
| **DIRECT** | 1-on-1 with a bot | Private DM with @researcher |
| **COORDINATION** | Leader-managed room | Autonomous coordination mode |

### Room Tasks

Each room can track **tasks** so your team’s work stays organized. Tasks belong to a room, have an owner and status, and include **handoff history** when ownership changes. When the Leader assigns a bot, nanofolks also creates a matching room task automatically so progress stays visible.

### Room-Centric Architecture

nanofolks uses a **room-centric architecture** where everything is organized by room. This provides:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Persistent Sessions** | Conversation history is stored per-room |
| **Cross-Platform Continuity** | Same room ID works across Telegram, Discord, CLI, etc. |
| **Organized Storage** | All data (sessions, memory, work logs) organized by room |
| **Easy Retrieval** | Find conversations by room name |

#### How It Works

```
room:general          → Default room for all conversations
room:project-abc123  → Project room (multi-platform)
```

#### Room Storage Architecture

```
~/.nanofolks/
├── rooms/
│   ├── general.json           # General room data
│   ├── project-abc123.json    # Project room
│   └── channel_mappings.json  # Maps channels to rooms
├── project_states/            # Per-room discovery/flow state
│   └── <room_id>.json
└── work_logs.db              # Per-room work logs
```

### The @ Mention System

Use **@** to direct messages to specific bots or the entire team:

#### Direct to a Bot
```
@researcher analyze market trends for Q3
→ Researcher responds with analysis

@coder implement user authentication
→ Coder writes the code

@creative design a landing page hero
→ Creative creates concepts
```

#### Broadcast to All
```
@all review this architecture proposal
→ All bots in the room respond with feedback

@team brainstorm marketing ideas
→ Relevant bots respond (based on keywords)
```

#### Leader Coordination (Default)
```
I need help planning the product launch
→ Leader coordinates which bots should help
→ May involve researcher (market), creative (branding), coder (landing page)
```

### How @ Routing Works

1. **@botname mentioned?** → Goes directly to that bot
2. **@all mentioned?** → Broadcast to all room participants
3. **@team mentioned?** → Relevant bots respond (keyword‑based)
4. **No mention?** → Leader analyzes and coordinates response

#### Best Practices

**When to use @mentions:**
- ✅ Use `@botname` when you know exactly who should help
- ✅ Use `@all` for brainstorming or decisions needing multiple perspectives
- ✅ No mention for general questions (Leader coordinates)

**Room organization:**
- Create PROJECT rooms for specific initiatives
- Keep #general as OPEN for casual chat
- Use DIRECT when you need a bot's specific expertise privately
- Leader can auto-create rooms when you describe a project

### Room Creation by Leader

The Leader can create rooms automatically when you ask:

```
You: Create a room for the website redesign project
Leader: Created room 'website-redesign' with appropriate team members

You: Set up a space for the Q4 planning
Leader: Created 'q4-planning' room with researcher and creative
```

### Shared Context

Rooms maintain shared context across the conversation:

```
You: @researcher find data on renewable energy
Researcher: [shares findings]

You: @creative use that data for an infographic
Creative: [accesses the same research context]

You: @coder build a dashboard with those stats
Coder: [references previous findings]
```

## 💓 Multi-Heartbeat System

nanofolks doesn't just wait for you to message it. It can proactively act.

### Routines (Scheduled Tasks)

nanofolks supports routines (scheduled tasks). There are two kinds:

- **Your Routines**: reminders or recurring tasks you create
- **Team Routines**: background check-ins that keep the team “alive”

You can control both from the CLI, without needing to know what a cron job is.

Example:

```bash
nanofolks routines add --name "morning" --message "What's on my calendar?" --schedule "0 9 * * *"
nanofolks routines list
nanofolks routines remove <id>
```

### Proactive Wake-Up

Team routines:
- Wakes nanofolks at scheduled times
- Runs background tasks
- Can message you proactively
- Maintains state between runs

### Activity Tracking

Monitors when you're active to:
- Determine when to run background processing
- Avoid interrupting conversations
- Optimize memory extraction timing


## 📝 Work Logs

nanofolks maintains persistent logs of completed work for future reference.

### What Gets Logged

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Task completions | Timestamps, outcomes |
| Tool executions | Results, errors |
| Research | Findings, sources |
| Artifacts | Generated files, code |

### Why It Matters

Work logs enable:
- **Audit trail** - Know what was done and when
- **Context continuity** - Pick up where you left off
- **Reference** - Look back at previous solutions
- **Learning** - nanofolks improves from past work

### Access

Work logs are stored in the workspace and can be:
- Searched via memory commands
- Referenced in conversations
- Exported for external use

## Skills

### How Skills Work

nanofolks uses **progressive loading** to keep responses fast:

1. **Skills Summary** - All available skills are listed in the system prompt with name, description, and file path
2. **On-Demand Loading** - When the agent needs a skill, it reads the skill file automatically
3. **Zero Overhead** - Full skill instructions only load when actually used

This keeps every conversation lightweight while giving access to all capabilities.

### Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `humanizer` | Remove AI writing patterns from text |
| `github` | GitHub CLI integration |
| `weather` | Weather info (wttr.in, Open-Meteo) |
| `summarize` | URL, file, and YouTube summarization |
| `tmux` | Terminal session management |
| `skill-creator` | Create new skills |

### Adding Custom Skills

Place a `SKILL.md` file in `workspace/skills/your-skill/`. It will be auto-discovered and security-scanned before becoming available.

> [!TIP]
> See [Skill Security](#skill-security) below for details on the scanning process.

### Skill CLI Commands

```bash
nanofolks skills list              # List all available skills with status
nanofolks skills scan <path>       # Security scan a skill before adding
nanofolks skills approve <name>    # Manually approve a skill after review
```


## Scheduled Tasks

```bash
nanofolks routines add --name "task" --message "Do X" --schedule "0 9 * * *"
nanofolks routines list
nanofolks routines remove <id>
```
