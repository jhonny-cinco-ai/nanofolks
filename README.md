# Core Concepts

This section explains the architectural concepts behind Nanofolks. Understanding these will help you configure and customize your crew.


## 🧠 Memory System

Nanofolks has a production-hardened memory system that learns from every conversation.

### How It Works

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Event Logging** | Every message (user and assistant) is stored in a local SQLite database with full conversation context |
| **Entity Extraction** | The system automatically identifies people, places, organizations, and concepts mentioned in conversations |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Entities are connected through relationships, creating a map of what you've discussed |
| **Preference Learning** | Nanofolks detects feedback patterns and learns your communication style, preferences, and habits over time |
| **Context Assembly** | When you send a message, Nanofolks retrieves relevant memories and assembles them into context |

### Why It Matters

Unlike simple chat histories, Nanofolks builds a persistent knowledge base that:
- Survives restarts and new conversations
- Connects related information across time
- Improves the more you use it

---


## 💭 Chain of Thought

Nanofolks doesn't just respond. It thinks through problems.

### The Pattern

```
Observation → Thought → Action → Observation → Thought → (repeat)
```

### Multi-Turn Reasoning

For complex tasks, Nanofolks can:
- Break down problems into steps
- Plan before executing
- Reflect on intermediate results
- Correct mistakes mid-process

### Tool Execution Loop

When tools are needed, Nanofolks:
1. Decides which tool to use
2. Executes the tool
3. Observes the result
4. Incorporates results into thinking
5. Continues or responds

---


## 📦 Context Compaction

Long conversations can exceed AI model limits. Nanofolks intelligently manages this.

### The Problem

AI models have maximum context windows (typically 8K-200K tokens). Without management:
- Conversations eventually hit the limit
- Old context gets dropped
- Nanofolks "forgets" earlier parts of the conversation

### How Compaction Works

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Token Tracking** | Real-time counting using tiktoken (not estimates) |
| **Threshold Warning** | 70% → shows warning in response |
| **Compaction Trigger** | 80% → triggers smart compression |
| **Tool Chain Safety** | Never separates tool calls from results |

### Compaction Modes

| Mode | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| **Summary** | Default - AI generates smart summaries |
| **Token-Limit** | Emergency - preserves recent messages only |
| **Off** | Manual - you control when to compact |

### Large Output Handling

Tool outputs over 10KB are stored separately in SQLite to prevent:
- API errors from oversized payloads
- Context pollution
- Cost overruns

---


## 🎯 Tier-Aware Routing

Not every message needs the most powerful (and expensive) AI model. Nanofolks intelligently routes messages to appropriate models.

### The Two-Layer System

```
User Message
    ↓
Layer 1: Client-Side Classification (~1ms)
  → Fast heuristic analysis
  → Handles ~85% of messages instantly
    ↓ (if ambiguous)
Layer 2: LLM-Assisted Classification (~200ms)
  → More accurate edge case handling
    ↓
Execute with Selected Model
```

### Tiers

| Tier | When Used | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Simple** | Quick questions | "What's the weather?" |
| **Medium** | General tasks | "Write me an email" |
| **Complex** | Detailed work | "Analyze this data" |
| **Reasoning** | Logic problems | "Prove this theorem" |
| **Coding** | Programming | "Debug this function" |

### Sticky Routing

Once a tier is selected, it "sticks" for the conversation context:
- Consistent responses
- Cost predictability
- Better coherence

### Cost Savings

> [!NOTE]
> These figures are estimates based on typical usage patterns. Actual savings depend on your message distribution and model selection. Run `nanofolks routing analytics` to see your real cost data.

Typical usage (45% simple, 35% medium, 15% complex, 5% reasoning):

| Scenario | Cost per Million Tokens |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Without routing** | $75.00 (always best model) |
| **With routing** | $3.17 (blended) |
| **Savings** | **Up to 96%** 🎉 |

---


## 🛡️ Unified Security Architecture

Nanofolks implements a unified security architecture that protects credentials across all entry points - from user chat input to automated tasks like heartbeat and skill loading.

### Core Protection Layers

| Layer | What It Protects | Implementation |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| **1. Secure Storage** | Keys at rest | OS Keyring (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service) |
| **2. Symbolic References** | Keys in transit | `{{key_name}}` resolved at execution time, never sent to LLM |
| **3. Credential Detection** | Keys in user input | Auto-detects API keys/tokens before they reach LLM |
| **4. Runtime Resolution** | Keys at execution | KeyVault resolves refs only when tools actually run |
| **5. Safe Logging** | Keys in logs | Audit logs contain only references, never actual keys |
| **6. Defense in Depth** | Keys in edge cases | Secret Sanitizer (regex masking) as final fallback |

#### Layer 6: Secret Sanitizer (Defense in Depth)

The Secret Sanitizer serves as the final safety net, catching any credentials that might slip through the primary layers:

**What It Detects:**
- API keys (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, etc.)
- Tokens (Bearer tokens, JWTs)
- Credentials (Passwords, database strings)
- Keys (Private keys, SSH credentials)

**Where It Applies:**

| Location | Protection |
|----------|------------|
| **AI Messages** | Secrets masked before reaching the LLM |
| **Log Files** | Nothing sensitive written to disk |
| **Session History** | Stored conversations have secrets removed |
| **Tool Outputs** | Results screened before display |

**Example:**
```
Input:  "My API key is sk-or-v1-abc123..."
Output: "My API key is sk-or-v1-ab***..." (masked)
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Secret Sanitizer is a **secondary** defense layer. The primary protection is the symbolic reference system (Layers 1-5) which prevents keys from ever being exposed.

### How It Works: The Security Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. USER INPUT                                                 │
│ "Create PR using token ghp_abc123xyz"                        │
└──────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                           ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 2. CREDENTIAL DETECTION                                       │
│ Detects: ghp_abc123xyz → github_token                        │
│ Converts to: "Create PR using token {{github_token}}"       │
└──────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                           ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 3. LLM PROCESSES (symbolic refs only)                        │
│ LLM sees: {{github_token}}                                   │
└──────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                           ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 4. TOOL EXECUTION                                             │
│ ToolRegistry.resolve_symbolic_params() → KeyVault.get()      │
│ {{github_token}} → ghp_abc123xyz (briefly in memory)       │
└──────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                           ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 5. AUDIT LOG                                                  │
│ Logged: "Used {{github_token}}" (never the actual key)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### CLI Commands

```bash

## 🤖 Multi-Bot Architecture

Nanofolks supports multiple AI characters working together as a crew.

### The Crew Concept

A "crew" is a group of 6 AI characters, each with:

- **Personality** - How they respond (from the theme)
- **Role** - What they're good at
- **Expertise** - Specific knowledge domains

### Your Team

Each Nanofolks crew has 6 bots:

| Bot | Role | Expertise |
|-----|------|-----------|
| **Leader** (@leader) | Coordinates the crew | Planning, delegation, decision-making |
| **Researcher** (@researcher) | Deep research | Analysis, information gathering |
| **Coder** (@coder) | Technical implementation | Code, debugging, architecture |
| **Social** (@social) | Community engagement | Communication, user relations |
| **Creative** (@creative) | Creative work | Design, brainstorming, content |
| **Auditor** (@auditor) | Quality review | Validation, compliance, testing |

### How It Works

```
Workspace/
├── bots/
│   ├── leader.yaml      # Primary bot
│   ├── specialist.yaml # Additional bots
│   └── creative.yaml
├── memory/             # Shared knowledge
├── skills/             # Crew skills
└── config.yaml         # Crew configuration
```

### Single Bot Mode

Not ready for a full crew? Nanofolks works perfectly as a single assistant:
- Default workspace has one bot
- Works in DM mode
- Same memory and learning capabilities
- Easy to add more bots later

### Why Multiple Bots?

| Benefit | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Specialization** | Coding bot, research bot |
| **Personality** | Different characters for moods |
| **Collaboration** | Bots discuss and debate |
| **Reliability** | Backup if one is unavailable |

---


## 🏠 Rooms & Collaboration

Nanofolks uses **rooms** as collaboration spaces where your crew works together. Think of rooms as dedicated spaces for different projects, topics, or conversation types.

### What Are Rooms?

A **room** is a conversation context where:
- Multiple bots can participate together
- Context is shared among all participants
- Bots can @mention each other to collaborate
- Work gets coordinated through the Leader

### Room Types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **OPEN** | General discussion room | Casual chat, #general |
| **PROJECT** | Focused team workspace | Specific projects with deadlines |
| **DIRECT** | 1-on-1 with a bot | Private DM with @researcher |
| **COORDINATION** | Leader-managed room | Autonomous coordination mode |

### Creating and Managing Rooms

## Current Architecture
Nanofolks uses a room-centric architecture where rooms are the primary collaboration spaces. Rooms persist context across conversations and are accessible across platforms using a consistent room ID. Key aspects:
- Room types: OPEN, PROJECT, DIRECT, COORDINATION
- Cross-platform continuity: room IDs work in CLI, Telegram, Discord, etc.
- Storage: per-room JSON files under ~/.nanofolks/rooms and a channel_mappings.json to route channels to rooms
- Leader coordinates and bots participate within rooms

Create rooms for different projects or contexts:

```bash

## 💓 Multi-Heartbeat System

Nanofolks doesn't just wait for you to message it. It can proactively act.

### Scheduled Tasks (Cron)

```bash

## 📝 Work Logs

Nanofolks maintains persistent logs of completed work for future reference.

### What Gets Logged

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Task completions | Timestamps, outcomes |
| Tool executions | Results, errors |
| Research | Findings, sources |
| Artifacts | Generated files, code |

### Why It Matters

Work logs enable:
- **Audit trail** - Know what was done and when
- **Context continuity** - Pick up where you left off
- **Reference** - Look back at previous solutions
- **Learning** - Nanofolks improves from past work

### Access

Work logs are stored in the workspace and can be:
- Searched via memory commands
- Referenced in conversations
- Exported for external use

---

---


# Philosophy

Nanofolks isn't about replacing you.

It's about expanding what you can do, by surrounding you with the right crew.

We believe AI should:
- Work *with* you, not *for* you
- Have personality and character
- Learn and improve over time
- Feel like a team, not a tool

# Check keyring status
nanofolks security status


# List all API keys and their storage location
nanofolks security list


# Add a key to the OS keyring
nanofolks security add openrouter


# Migrate existing keys from config to keyring
nanofolks security migrate-to-keyring


# Remove a key from keyring
nanofolks security remove openrouter
```

### Benefits

- **API keys never in config file**: Stored in OS keyring instead of plain JSON
- **LLM never sees keys**: Only symbolic references like `{{openrouter_key}}`
- **Memory protection**: Keys locked in memory and wiped after use
- **Safe logging**: Audit logs contain only references, never actual keys
- **Anomaly detection**: Monitors for suspicious usage patterns

> [!NOTE]
> The legacy Secret Sanitizer (regex-based masking) still works as a secondary layer of defense.

### Skills Security & Verification

Skills extend Nanofolks' capabilities. Before any skill is used, it goes through security verification.

#### Security Scanning Process

```
┌─────────────────┐
│ 1. Auto-Detect │
│   New skills   │
└────────┬────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ 2. Risk Scoring │
│   Analyze code │
└────────┬────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ 3. Approval     │
│   Block if risk │
└────────┬────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│ 4. Runtime      │
│   Verification  │
└─────────────────┘
```

#### Risk Levels

| Level | Icon | Examples |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Critical** | 🚫 | Credential theft, malware |
| **High** | ⚠️ | Shell injection, system mods |
| **Medium** | ⚡ | Obfuscation, suspicious downloads |
| **Low** | ℹ️ | Binary execution, external URLs |

### Contextual Protections

#### HEARTBEAT.md Security

When heartbeat tasks read `HEARTBEAT.md`:

1. **Automatic scanning** - Credentials detected when file is read
2. **Warning system** - Users alerted if secrets found
3. **Automatic conversion** - Keys converted to `{{symbolic_ref}}` before LLM
4. **Chat remediation** - "Please secure the keys in HEARTBEAT.md" → agent fixes it

Example workflow:
```
You: "Please secure the keys in HEARTBEAT.md"
Agent: Uses secure_remediate tool → Stores keys → Updates file with {{symbolic_ref}}
```

#### MCP Server Security

MCP servers support symbolic references in environment variables:

```yaml

# config.yaml
mcp_servers:
  my_server:
    command: "npx"
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path"]
    env:
      OPENAI_API_KEY: "{{openai_key}}"  # Resolved from KeyVault
```

#### Chat-Based Remediation

The `secure_remediate` tool helps users fix security issues directly in chat:

```bash

# Agent can use these tools:
- secure_remediate(file_path="HEARTBEAT.md", action="scan")     # Scan for credentials
- secure_remediate(file_path="HEARTBEAT.md", action="store_and_fix", key_type="github_token", api_key="...")
```

Users can simply say: "Please secure the keys in HEARTBEAT.md" and the agent will help fix it.

# Every morning at 9am
nanofolks cron add --name "morning" --message "What's on my calendar?" --cron "0 9 * * *"


# Hourly health checks
nanofolks cron add --name "hourly" --message "Check system status" --every 3600
```

### Proactive Wake-Up

The heartbeat system:
- Wakes Nanofolks at scheduled times
- Runs background tasks
- Can message you proactively
- Maintains state between runs

### Activity Tracking

Monitors when you're active to:
- Determine when to run background processing
- Avoid interrupting conversations
- Optimize memory extraction timing

# Create a new project room
nanofolks room create project-alpha


# Invite bots to the room
nanofolks room invite project-alpha researcher
nanofolks room invite project-alpha coder
nanofolks room invite project-alpha creative


# See who's in the room
nanofolks room show project-alpha


# List all your rooms
nanofolks room list
```

### The @ Mention System

Use **@** to direct messages to specific bots or the entire crew:

#### Direct to a Bot
```
@researcher analyze market trends for Q3
→ ResearcherBot responds with analysis

@coder implement user authentication
→ CoderBot writes the code

@creative design a landing page hero
→ CreativeBot creates concepts
```

#### Broadcast to All
```
@all review this architecture proposal
→ All bots in the room respond with feedback

@crew brainstorm marketing ideas
→ Entire crew collaborates on ideas
```

#### Leader Coordination (Default)
```
I need help planning the product launch
→ Leader coordinates which bots should help
→ May involve researcher (market), creative (branding), coder (landing page)
```

### How @ Routing Works

When you send a message, Nanofolks intelligently routes it:

1. **@botname mentioned?** → Goes directly to that bot
2. **@all or @crew mentioned?** → Broadcast to all room participants
3. **No mention?** → Leader analyzes and coordinates response

```
You: @researcher find competitors in the AI space
    ↓
ResearcherBot: Here's what I found...

You: @all what do you think of this strategy?

ResearcherBot: From a data perspective...
CreativeBot: The branding approach should be...
CoderBot: Technically, we could implement...
Leader: Let me synthesize these perspectives...
```

### Direct Messages (DMs)

Chat with a single bot privately without room context:

```bash

# DM a specific bot
nanofolks agent -m "@researcher analyze this data privately"


# Or enter interactive mode and use @ mentions
nanofolks agent
> @researcher what are the latest trends?
```

**DMs vs Rooms:**
- **DMs** → Private 1-on-1, bot's individual expertise
- **Rooms** → Collaborative, shared context, multiple perspectives

### Room Creation by Leader

The Leader can create rooms automatically when you ask:

```
You: Create a room for the website redesign project
Leader: Created room 'website-redesign' with appropriate team members

You: Set up a space for the Q4 planning
Leader: Created 'q4-planning' room with researcher and creative
```

### Shared Context

Rooms maintain shared context across the conversation:

```
You: @researcher find data on renewable energy
ResearcherBot: [shares findings]

You: @creative use that data for an infographic
CreativeBot: [accesses the same research context]

You: @coder build a dashboard with those stats
CoderBot: [references previous findings]
```

### Room-Centric Architecture

Nanofolks uses a **room-centric architecture** where everything is organized by room. This provides:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Persistent Sessions** | Conversation history is stored per-room, not per-channel |
| **Cross-Platform Continuity** | Same room ID works across Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc. |
| **Organized Storage** | All data (sessions, memory, work logs) organized by room |
| **Easy Retrieval** | Find conversations by room name, not obscure session IDs |

#### How It Works

```
room:cli_default          → CLI conversations
room:telegram_123456      → Telegram chat
room:discord_987654       → Discord channel
room:project_website      → Project room (multi-platform)
```

#### Storage Structure

```
 ~/.nanofolks/
 ├── rooms/
 │   ├── general.json        # General room data
 │   ├── website-redesign.json
 │   └── <room_id>.json
 │   channel_mappings.json   # channel:room mappings (room-centric routing)
 ├── project_states/         # Per-room discovery/flow state files
 │   └── <room_id>.json
 └── work_logs.db
 ```

#### Cross-Platform Rooms

Create rooms that work across platforms:

```bash
# Create a project room
nanofolks room create website-redesign

# Join from any platform - same room, same context
# Telegram: @nanofolks invite me to website-redesign
# Discord: /invite website-redesign
# CLI: nanofolks room join website-redesign
```

### CLI Commands for Rooms

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `nanofolks room list` | Show all rooms |
| `nanofolks room create <name>` | Create new room |
| `nanofolks room invite <room> <bot>` | Add bot to room |
| `nanofolks room remove <room> <bot>` | Remove bot from room |
| `nanofolks room show <room>` | Show room details |

### Best Practices

**When to use @mentions:**
- ✅ Use `@botname` when you know exactly who should help
- ✅ Use `@all` for brainstorming or decisions needing multiple perspectives
- ✅ No mention for general questions (Leader coordinates)

**Room organization:**
- Create PROJECT rooms for specific initiatives
- Keep #general as OPEN for casual chat
- Use DIRECT when you need a bot's specific expertise privately
- Leader can auto-create rooms when you describe a project
