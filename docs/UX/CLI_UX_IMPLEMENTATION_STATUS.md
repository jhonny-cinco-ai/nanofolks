  - Get room by ID with `get_room(room_id)`
  - Invite bots with `invite_bot(room_id, bot_name)`
  - Switch rooms functionality
  - Persistent storage (JSON-based)
  - Default "general" room created automatically

#### 2. **Room UI Components**
- [x] **room_ui.py module** - Comprehensive UI components at `nanofolks/cli/room_ui.py`

- [x] **/invite** command - Invite bots with `/invite <bot> [reason]`
- [x] **/switch** command - Switch rooms with `/switch <room>`
- [x] **/list-rooms** or **/rooms** - List all available rooms
  - Renders as Rich table with room name, type, bot count, status
  - Shows current active room with highlight

#### 4. **AI-Assisted Room Creation**
- [x] **Intent detection** - `_detect_room_creation_intent()` function
  - Analyzes user messages to detect room creation requests
  - Uses LLM (ROOM_CREATION_PROMPT) to analyze intent
  - Returns structured JSON with recommendations
  
- [x] **Intent handling** - `_handle_room_creation_intent()` function
  - Displays room analysis and bot recommendations
  - Gets user confirmation before creating
  - Creates room and invites recommended bots

  - Format: `[#room_id] You: `
  - Updates when switching rooms

#### 6. **Helper Functions**
- [x] **_looks_like_room_creation_request()** - Pattern matching
  - Checks for keywords like "create room", "new project", etc.
  - Reduces unnecessary LLM calls
  - Pattern-based quick filtering

### ⚠️ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**

#### 1. **Enhanced UI Layout (Phase 3-4)**
- [x] StatusBar rendering - Implemented
  - Shows current room and participant count
  - Used in status display

- ⚠️ Team roster sidebar - Basic version exists
  - `render()` method exists
  - `render_compact()` not fully utilized
  - Not integrated into main loop display

- ⚠️ Room list sidebar - Basic version exists
  - Table rendering works
  - List rendering for sidebar exists
  - Not integrated into main loop display

- ❌ True side-by-side layout
  - `render_sidebar_layout()` exists but uses simple stacking
  - Rich Layout not yet implemented (noted as optional in design)
  - Terminal compatibility reason given

#### 2. **Team Roster Integration**
- [x] `TeamRoster` class fully implemented
- ⚠️ Not displayed continuously in interactive loop
  - Could show after room switch
  - Could show in status updates
  - Not rendered in main chat interface

#### 3. **Room Switching Workflow**
- [x] /switch command implemented
- ⚠️ Sidebar not updated on switch

---

### ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

#### 1. **Advanced Layout Features (Phase 4 - Optional)**
- ❌ Rich Layout for true side-by-side display
  - Noted as optional in design doc
  - Would require complex terminal handling
  - Simple stacking approach currently used

- ❌ Live sidebar updates
  - Sidebar components exist but not live-updating
  - Would require multi-threaded display management

- ❌ Smooth transitions
  - No animation between room switches
  - No progress indicators during bot coordination

- ❌ History scrolling in chat area
  - Messages are printed, not stored in scrollable view
  - Would require full UI framework

#### 2. **Full Sidebar Display in Interactive Mode**
- ❌ Team roster continuously visible in chat loop
- ❌ Room list continuously visible in chat loop
- ❌ Status bar in top of interactive loop
- **Current behavior**: These components are implemented but used in isolated commands, not in the main interactive loop

#### 3. **Visual Indicators (Partial)**
- ❌ In-room indicators next to bot names (only in roster render)
- ❌ Current room highlighted in list (only in list render)
- ✓ Basic status indicators exist
