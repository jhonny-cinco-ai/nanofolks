## 📋 Implementation Checklist

From: `ROOM_QUESTIONS_ANSWERED.md` Q&A #5

```
To enable in-session room management:

[ ] Add /create <name> handler
[ ] Add /invite <bot> handler
[ ] Add /switch <room> handler
[ ] Add /list-rooms handler
[ ] Add helper function _get_room_icon()
[ ] Update help text with new commands
[ ] Test all workflows:
    [ ] Create room with type
    [ ] Invite multiple bots
    [ ] Switch between rooms
    [ ] List rooms
    [ ] Work logs show room changes
[ ] Update CLI help documentation
```

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

**From:** `docs/room_interaction_cli_workflow.md` Part 10

### Phase 1: Room Discovery (✅ Complete)
- Auto-create general room ✅
- Load existing rooms ✅
- Join with `--room` parameter ✅
- Show room context ✅

### Phase 2: In-Session Management (⏳ Ready to Build)
- [ ] `/create <name>` command
- [ ] `/invite <bot>` command
- [ ] `/switch <room>` command
- [ ] `/list-rooms` command
- [ ] Real-time room switching
- [ ] Work log per-room tracking

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (🔮 Future)
- `/archive <room>` - Archive old rooms
- `/remove <bot>` - Remove bot from room
- `/rename <old> <new>` - Rename room
- `/set-type <type>` - Change room type
- Room artifacts & shared memory
- Room permissions & access control

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Room Model
- **ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., "general", "project-alpha")
- **Type**: OPEN, PROJECT, DIRECT, or COORDINATION
- **Participants**: List of bots in the room
- **Storage**: `~/.nanofolks/rooms/{id}.json`

### Room Manager
- Loads/creates rooms on startup
- Always creates "general" room if missing
- Persists rooms to disk
- Handles room lifecycle

### Room Context
- Passed through entire agent flow
- Included in system prompt
- Tracked in work logs
- Shows in CLI prompt

### Session vs Room
- **Session**: Conversation history (per-session)
- **Room**: Team composition (persistent)
- Can have multiple rooms, one session per room

---

## 🎯 What's Done vs What's Next

### ✅ Currently Implemented

**Room System Core:**
- Auto-create general room
- Load/save rooms to disk
- Join rooms with --room parameter
- Graceful fallback to general

**CLI Integration:**
- Room parameter added
- TUI header with room context
- Prompt shows room indicator
- /room command implemented
- Work logs track room context

**Agent Integration:**
- Room context in system prompt
- Agent understands room & team
- Multi-bot coordination awareness
- Room info in work logs

**Documentation:**
- Complete user guide
- Technical documentation
- Architecture explanations
- Code examples

### ⏳ Ready to Implement (Not Yet Done)

**In-Session Commands:**
- /create <name> - Create room without exiting
- /invite <bot> - Add bot to current room
- /switch <room> - Change rooms mid-conversation
- /list-rooms - Show all available rooms

**Why not yet?**
- Core infrastructure complete
- Design fully specified
- Code examples provided
- Just needs integration into interactive loop

**Effort to implement:** 2-3 hours
