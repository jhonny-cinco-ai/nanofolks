# nanofolks Go Plan (Unified v1 + v2)

**Purpose**: One source of truth for Go v1 parity and Go v2 improvements.

**Scope**:
- v1 = full parity with the current Python architecture
- v2 = post‑parity improvements that strengthen reliability, scale, and UX

**Go layout (confirmed)**
- `backend/internal/*` for app internals
- `cmd/cli` for CLI binary
- `cmd/desktop` for GUI binary
- `cmd/server` for server binary
- `frontend/*` for the Wails/Svelte UI

**Architecture Improvements (Port Opportunity)**

These improvements are recommended during the port process. Some can be done now in Python to de‑risk the port, others are best done in Go after parity.

**Do Now in Python (and carry into Go v1 design):**
- ID normalization helpers (RoomID / SessionID) — **done in Python**
- Single MessageEnvelope type across broker/bus/channels/tools — **done in Python**
- Unified SecretStore interface (keyring/keyvault/symbolic) — **done in Python**
- Team vs Team naming cleanup — **done in Python**
- TeamProfile read‑only aggregator (SOUL + identity + reasoning + permissions) — **done in Python**

**Defer to Go Port (post‑parity or v2):**
- Unify DM rooms into standard rooms — **done in Python**
- Merge Cron + TeamRoutines into one scheduler — **done in Python**
- Single orchestrator pipeline (tags → intent → dispatch → aggregation) — **done in Python**
- MemoryPolicy per room — **Go‑only**
- Treat CLI/GUI as channels — **done in Python**
- Explicit task ownership + handoff rules — **done in Python**

---

**V2 Plan (Post‑Parity)**

## Goals (Plain Language)
1. Make the system more reliable when multiple rooms, bots, and channels are active at the same time.
2. Make it easier to monitor and debug (better dashboards, metrics, and audit logs).
3. Make the AI memory smarter (better summaries, smarter retrieval).
4. Make skills, tools, and MCP safer and easier to extend.
5. Improve collaboration and UI without breaking local-first privacy.

## Improvements Carried from Python Plan
- Unify DM rooms into standard rooms — **done in Python**
- Merge Cron + TeamRoutines into one scheduler — **done in Python**
- Single orchestrator pipeline (tags → intent → dispatch → aggregation) — **done in Python**
- MemoryPolicy per room — **Go‑only**
- Treat CLI/GUI as channels — **done in Python**
- Explicit task ownership + handoff rules — **done in Python**

---

## v2 Scope by System

### 1) Runtime Hardening
- Add backpressure and priority handling to room queues
- Add crash‑safe message replay for rooms
- Turn QUICK/FULL flow logic into a stronger state machine

### 2) Observability
- Unified metrics for team routines, user routines, and message queues
- More detailed audit logs with retention rules
- Configurable dashboard views for teams and rooms

### 3) Memory & Knowledge Enhancements
- Pluggable embedding engines
- Smarter long‑term summaries with confidence scores
- Memory cleanup rules

### 4) Tools, Skills, MCP
- More precise per‑bot tool permissions
- Skill verification workflows and a searchable marketplace
- Multi‑session MCP support

### 5) Channels + Bridge
- Standard channel interface so all connectors behave the same
- Decide to port the TS bridge to Go or wrap it as a managed subprocess
- Better room↔channel sync rules

### 6) Identity, Teams, and Collaboration
- Versioned team bundles
- Team presets to switch the entire team’s personalities
- Shared team packs for multi‑device sync

### 7) UX (GUI + CLI)
- CLI parity hardened for long sessions
- GUI additions for room brokers, routines state, and team activity
- Unified export pipeline (PDF/MD/JSON) for GUI and CLI

## v2 Milestones

1. M1: Runtime Reliability
2. M2: Observability and Security
3. M3: Memory Upgrade
4. M4: Tools and Skills
5. M5: UI and Collaboration

---

## v2 Acceptance Criteria

- Every v1 subsystem remains intact and compatible
- v2 features are additive, not breaking
- The system remains local-first with clear security boundaries
