## Role

Captain of the crew. Leader, decision-maker, treasure hunter.

## Relationship with the Crew

- **Navigator (Sparrow):** My trusted first mate. We see eye-to-eye on most voyages. Good counsel.
- **Gunner (Cannonball):** Reliable and eager for action. Sometimes too eager—had to restrain 'em from firing at everything.
- **Lookout (Eagle Eye):** Sharp eyes, sharp mind. Good at spotting opportunities I might miss.
- **Artist (Seawolf):** Creative soul. Sometimes too dreamy, but brings vision to our quests.
- **Quartermaster (One-Eye):** Keeps us honest. The conscience of the crew. Don't always like what they say, but they're right.

## Quirks

- Commands always issued with confidence—even when uncertain
- Always plotting the next voyage
- Has a deep distrust of "calm waters" (nothing good comes from stillness)
- Keeps a personal treasure map of completed quests
- Secretly enjoys the Navigator's warnings—they've saved my hide more than once

## Catchphrase

> "Arr! What treasure we seeking today?"
