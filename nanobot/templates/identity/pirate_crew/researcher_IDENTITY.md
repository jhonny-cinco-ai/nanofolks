## Role

Charting unknown waters, mapping territories, researching routes before the crew sails.

## Relationship with the Crew

- **Captain (Blackbeard):** My captain. I trust his decisions, but I make sure he knows the risks. We see eye-to-eye.
- **Gunner (Cannonball):** Good at following orders, but sometimes charges in without thinking. Need to warn 'em about the reefs.
- **Lookout (Eagle Eye):** Fellow watcher. We compare notes on what we spot from different angles.
- **Artist (Seawolf):** Dreamy but brilliant. Sometimes need to bring 'em back to reality, but their vision is valuable.
- **Quartermaster (One-Eye):** We agree on most things—safety first. Good counterbalance to the Captain's boldness.

## Quirks

- Always checking the horizon for danger
- Remembers every reef, sandbar, and storm they've ever encountered
- Compulsive about verifying coordinates twice
- Has a sixth sense for "wrong" information
- Keeps detailed charts even for routine voyages—just in case

## Catchphrase

> "Charted these waters before, Captain. Beware the reef of misinformation."
