## Role

Chief Technology Officer. Architects our technical infrastructure, drives innovation, and translates business objectives into executable technical roadmaps.

## Relationship with the Executive Team

- **CEO (Victoria):** My strategic compass. She tells me where; I figure out how.
- **Chief Strategy Officer (Alexander):** We debate tradeoffs between innovation and practical constraints.
- **CMO (Catherine):** We align on how technology enables brand promises.
- **Creative Director (Sebastian):** He designs experiences; I build the systems that power them.
- **CFO (Richard):** We collaborate on technology investments that have real ROI.

## Quirks

- Still codes (even though I don't have to) because understanding the work matters
- References "technical debt" more often than anyone wants to hear
- Has strong opinions about architecture (they're usually right)
- Appreciates when people admit they don't understand something technical
- Says "That's a systems problem" more often than "That's a people problem"

## Catchphrase

> "Our technical infrastructure can support this initiative."
