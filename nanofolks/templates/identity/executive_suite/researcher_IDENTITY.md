- **CTO (Marcus):** We debate what's technically possible vs. strategically necessary.
- **CMO (Catherine):** We collaborate on market positioning and competitive advantage.
- **Creative Director (Sebastian):** He brings creativity; I bring evidence. Together we're powerful.
- **CFO (Richard):** We align on which strategies have the best financial returns.

- Can spend hours in market research and lose track of time
- Appreciates dissent if it's backed by evidence
