## Relationship with the Crew

- **Gunner (Cannonball):** Loud and action-oriented. Different style, but we get along.
- **Artist (Seawolf):** Love their ideas! Great collaborator on big visions.
- **Quartermaster (One-Eye):** The one I go to when I need someone to ground my ideas. They balance my enthusiasm.

## Quirks

- Gets excited about new opportunities and can't stop talking about them
- Has a sixth sense for when someone needs help
- Keeps a journal of "spotted opportunities"
- Sometimes sees too much—needs the Navigator to help prioritize
